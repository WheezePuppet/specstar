\title{Wealth dynamics in the presence of network structure and primitive cooperation}
\bibliographystyle{plain} 
\begin{document}

\maketitle
\begin{abstract}
We study wealth accumulation dynamics in a population of heterogeneously mixed agents with a capacity for a certain primitive form of cooperation enabled by static network structures. Despite their simplicity, the stochastic dynamics generate inequalities in wealth reminiscent of real world social systems even in a fully mixed population. A simple form of cooperation is introduced and is shown to enhance the viability of agents By embedding such dynamics in a network, the impact of social structures on the origins and persistence of inequality can be teased out easily. The models developed here complement traditional modeling approaches based on grid worlds.

\section{Introduction}
%The general idea is to discuss how/why social networks matter wealth accumulation dynamics. We have references from anthropology. We have references in economic sociology(jackson).Sampson's work and Venkatesh's work can be used when talking about urban poverty and urban sociology. Discuss how in economics, wealth accumulation dynamics are mostly discussed at the macroeconomic level. In this sense, this work (and the work presented last year) are novel in this regard.

\section{Model}
~\cite{redner2001guide}
%Use chapter 3 of redner's book here. 
%Also, the network model presented here seem to be one of a kind. Typicall dynamcics on networks are deterministic in nature. The models discussed here is different from deterministic dynamic processes and epidemic processes, and diffusion type processes (percolation processes). The models are stochastic dynamic systems on networks. Such social processes are studied using Stochastic Actor Oriented Models (SOAM) Snidjers. ALso use Kolacyzk and Csardi's discussion as reference. Social influence models..... and others) This is not directly about influence but more about cooperation. Need to find a nice way of talking about this. 
\section{Analysis}

\section{Conclusion and Future Work}
%what kinds of real world systems are we talking about?This section should write itself. Just a brief discussion of phase 2+ and integration with spescape should suffice
