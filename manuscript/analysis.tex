\subsection{Gini coefficient}

As mentioned in Section~\ref{giniKindaSucks}, the Gini coefficient is not the
ideal measure of inequality for our apocalyptic model. Nonetheless, it is
illustrative to see how it varies with respect to the ER $\lambda$ parameter.
Figure~\ref{fig:giniVsLambda} depicts the Gini computed \textit{at the onset
of stage 3} (before starvation) versus $\lambda$, and confirms that...
