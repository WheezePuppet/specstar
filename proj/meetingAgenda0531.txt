1. (5 mins) Welcome, chit-chat, and solving technology/connection issues.

2. (20 mins) Rajesh wants to categorize specific wealth generation processes
and proto-institution rules in terms of plausibility as a social mechanism (As
THE HANDBOOK says we should!). This means that we should categorize them
according to whether they are plausible mechanisms in

   - Prehistoric anthropology ( ..... SFI working group members)
   - Historical sociology (Hamilton, Canada)
   - Urban sociology (Poverty dynamics .....)
   - Economic sociology (Granovetter, Mathew Jackson,....)
   - Comparative economic sociology (Microcredit and other systems more
   popular in Asia and Africa)


3. (15 mins) How daily income should work for agents in net. Despite much
discussion, we still haven't decided this.

    * The Status quo is option II-A (see https://cssas.pubpub.org/pub/6nonmc56)
    * Sri -- likes the Stephen & TJ proposal (III)
    * Rajesh -- thinks Stephen & TJ proposal is too complex for phase 1
        (...does this imply a vote for II-A?...)
    * Olufemi -- votes for II-C "modified": modify agent salaries up/down less
        frequently than each iteration; give different protos different
        thresholds

    -> One idea: for paper1 (net only), we go with II-A, and do our analysis
with that simplest possible thing. For paper2 (scape vs. net), we implement
either II-C or III in an attempt to make scape and net as apples-to-apples as
possible.


4. (10 mins) Protos:
    - Deposits: Lump sum only when joining, or ongoing contributions? (c.f.
        Olufemi's Nigeria collectives)
    - Withdrawals: Currently only when an agent would die otherwise. Is this
        what we want?


5. (10 mins) Timeline moving forward in light of Jun 30 CSSSA19 deadline.
