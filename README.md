# SPECstar
##### "Social Primitives Experimental Cohort" -- A Special Interest Group (SIG) affiliated with [CSSSA](https://computationalsocialscience.org/)

We're interested in using agent-based modeling (ABM) to explore the possible
social primitives that produce empirical patterns of economic (and other forms
of) inequality.

SPEC**star** is currently composed of two related subprojects:

### SPECscape
The SPEC**scape** subproject uses a landscape grid as a modeling construct for agent and landscape interactions, in the spirit of [Sugarscape](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sugarscape) and [NetLogo](https://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/).

### SPECnet
The SPEC**net** subproject uses a social network as the key modeling construct,
where interactions are solely based on agent relationships, not geographic
proximity.

SPECnet develops its approach with reference to SPECscape and SPECscape develops its approach with reference to SPECnet. They are independent but they actively work to provide contrast where there are differences, build off commonalities where they exist, and seek useful complimentarities where the differences turn out to be useful enhancements.
